# 🌍 COVID-19 Vaccination Rollout Analysis

## 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes and visualizes the COVID-19 vaccination trends in three countries: **Australia**, **Algeria**, and **Argentina**. Using visual storytelling, we aim to uncover insights into how vaccination campaigns progressed, comparing speed, coverage, and anomalies in distribution.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize cumulative vaccinations over time for selected countries.
- Compare the percentage of the population vaccinated in each country.
- Display a choropleth map to visualize global vaccination disparity (filtered to selected countries).
- Highlight key patterns, anomalies, and observations using narrative markdown commentary.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas** – Data manipulation
- **matplotlib** – Line and pie charts
- **seaborn** – Enhanced line plots
- **plotly.express** – Interactive choropleth maps

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```
3. Open the `vaccination_analysis.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to generate plots and insights.

## 📊 Key Insights & Reflections

1. **Australia** had the most consistent and rapid vaccine rollout, resulting in the highest vaccination coverage.
2. **Argentina** showed strong early momentum and sustained coverage over time.
3. **Algeria** exhibited a slow and late-starting vaccination effort, with coverage significantly trailing the other two.
4. Pie charts clearly show disparities between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.
5. The choropleth map effectively highlights the uneven global va
